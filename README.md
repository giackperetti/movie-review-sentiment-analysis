# Movie Review Sentiment Classification with SVC

## Overview

This repository houses a Python implementation of a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) designed for binary sentiment classification on movie reviews. Utilizing Cornell University's Movie Review Sentiment Dataset, this project demonstrates how to preprocess text data, extract features, and train a robust SVC model to distinguish between positive and negative sentiments.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing:** Robust cleaning and preparation of raw movie review text.
- **Feature Extraction:** Leverages TF-IDF for converting text into numerical features suitable for machine learning.
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC):** Implements and trains an SVC model, a powerful algorithm for classification tasks.
- **Binary Sentiment Classification:** Predicts whether a given movie review expresses positive or negative sentiment.

## Dataset

This project uses the [**Cornell University Movie Review Sentiment Dataset**](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/). It consists of 1000 positive and 1000 negative movie reviews. This dataset is ideal for binary sentiment classification tasks and is commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) research.
